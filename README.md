Immich Swipe is an open-source Android application designed to make sorting your photos and videos hosted on your [Immich](https://immich.app/) server easy and fun.

This project is a fork based on the original project at [Minos2020/immich-swipe-android](https://github.com/Minos2020/immich-swipe-android). I created this fork to act as a rough draft for new ideas and features that I would love to see added in the future.

> **Disclaimer**: This is an independent project and is not affiliated in any way with the official Immich project.
